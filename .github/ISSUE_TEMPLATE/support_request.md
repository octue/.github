## Support request

### About me

If you're new to the octue ecosystem, and you don't mind, it'd be great to hear a little bit of the wider context about
you and what you're working on, so we can understand how best to help.


### Request

- [ ] I've searched the list of existing issues
- [ ] I expected the docs to cover it in [this section](please provide link to where you'd expect to find help on this in the docs) but they don't cover it.

I'm trying to [describe what you're trying to do].


### Supporting Octue

Octue is an Open-Source Software organisation helping you and many others to fight climate change. Providing support for your issues costs us c. 500GBP/day. Might your organisation be in a position to help sponsor this issue?
- [ ] We already are (eg via technical partnership or GitHub Sponsors )
- [ ] Yes (we'll prioritise this issue, and be in touch)
- [ ] No (we'll work on this issue as and when it aligns with our core development activity)
