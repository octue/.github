<!-- PRs into main are released as soon as they are merged. Their descriptions will be used directly to create release notes, so make sure they contain everything! -->
<!-- Anything added between the auto-generation marker comments will be replaced on every pushed commit, so make sure to add anything you want to add outside of them. -->
<!-- However, any part of the final PR description (i.e. the description at the point of the final commit to the PR) can be changed in release notes after release if required -->
<!-- Change "START" to "SKIP" in the autogeneration marker to stop any further automatic changes to the description. --->
